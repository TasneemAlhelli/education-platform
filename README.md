# Education Platform - EduHub

## About the Project

Our Education platform provides an interactive environment where teachers create and offer classes for students to enroll in. Each class is meticulously crafted by the teacher to ensure an engaging learning experience. Students can leave reviews, helping others make informed decisions about enrolling.

Teachers have the ability to supplement their classes with posts related to course content, updates, and additional resources. These posts are exclusively accessible to registered users, fostering a sense of community and collaboration among learners.

To maintain the integrity of the learning experience, only logged-in users can enroll in classes, ensuring a personalized and secure educational journey. Guest users can browse through classes and read reviews but they must register to access the full functionality of the platform.

In addition to the dynamic features mentioned above, our platform prioritizes communication and engagement between teachers and students. We have a dedicated Contact Us page. This page serves as a direct channel for users and visitors to connect with teachers on the platform.
